# Secure Code Village Challenges

This repository provides a collection of small coding exercises to practice secure coding and test security tooling across different areas such as SCA, SAST, and Secure Code Review.

## Structure

- The `Challenges` directory includes three categories:
  - `SCA`
  - `SAST`
  - `Secure_Code_Review`

Each category contains fifteen numbered challenge folders (`challenge 1` through `challenge 15`).

- The `Solutions` directory mirrors the `Challenges` structure and provides remediation examples for each challenge.

## Usage

Use tools like Semgrep, Checkmarx, or your preferred security scanners to analyze the challenges. You can then compare your findings with the provided solutions to understand remediation strategies and improve detection effectiveness.
